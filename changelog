abcde 2.3.99.4

  * Repaired multiple output encoding (Closes: #351362).
  * Added missing space on a [] test statement.
  * Added "default" action, so that one can add things on top of what we do
    regularly, without having to list everything: "-a default,playlist" works.
  * Restored all the > /dev/null instead of using grep -q, since it is not
    portable.
  * Added Solaris OS entry, in case we need to define things for it.

abcde 2.3.99.3

  * The "Mao es nuestro indiscutible lider" release.
  * Check the CDROMREADER options we have in Debian which we depend on. Thanks
    to Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo for finding the error.
  * New recursive option for local CDDB repositories, to cope with other
    players saving the entries.
  * Brand new CD backup procedure: rip a CD into a single FLAC trac with an
    embedded cuesheet using "-1 -M -o flac" and proceed to rip your tracks
    from the obtained file using "-d file.flac -o <format>". It needs
    cue2discid script from the examples directory to work. OH! If you manage
    to get it working with bash, we can get rid of the python dependency...
  * Initial steps to make abcde working with musicbrainz, although it is not
    ready yet.
  * Added a missing $ in a variable (Closes: #345629).
  * Added -p to the mkdir's for $ABCDETEMPDIR (Closes: #345630).
  * Added iconv + converted to utf-8 the charset of a ready-to-send CDDB
    entry (Closes: #345708).
  * Added AAC (Mpeg4) support.
  * Small cd-discid update. 

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 23:27:40 +0200

abcde 2.3.99.2

  * Missing bits in the 2.3.99.1 changelog:
    - Man page: added information about -z (Debug option).
    - Corrected config file with the BATCHNORM/NOGAP split
      (Closes: #337622).
    - Uses /bin/bash for the time being... We need to get some substitution
      functions/operations for the bashisms we have: Closes: #337139.
  * Config bits with corrected typos
  * Adding musicbrainz support. First bits.
  * Reworked comparison for numerical answer when selecting a CDDB output.
  * TODO updated

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Mon, 12 Dec 2005 23:46:58 +0200

abcde 2.3.99.1

  * Both -z and -C unset EJECTCD to avoid ejecting the CD when a) we are
    debuging and b) we are not using the CD.
  * If we are not reading the CD, set "loud" to see all the output messages
    (that is, in most of the cases, the first encoding).
  * Added -f to force some events that otherwise would erase files from our
    current run. In the standard configuration ("OUTPUT=vorbis") the following
    actions will need a "-f" to force the last one:
      abcde -a read,encode -o ogg,flac
      abcde -a tag,move,clean
    During the second run abcde should complain that it is trying to erase the
    working directory while the it has not performed any action on the FLAC
    files, which we encoded previously.
  * Convert the old cdparanoia-audio-tracks file into a status entry to avoid
    eating files from previous rounds using an early version (Closes: #341050)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Tue, 29 Nov 2005 23:27:20 +0200

abcde 2.3.99

  * Added diff choice to CDDB entries ("1,4").
  * Added SHOWCDDBFIELDS to allow the user to show YEAR and GENRE in the
    parsed CDDB output.
  * Suggests mkcue, and erase old cdgrab info since sarge is out.
  * Changed cdparanoia-audio-tracks to use the status file to save the data.
  * Added the possibility of using a singletrack flac file with an embeded
    cuesheet as a source of tracks.
  * Added -z for easy and quick debug.
  * BATCH has been splitted into two options: BATCHNORM which allows, by using
    -b, to use the -a normalize in all the files at once, and NOGAP, that by
    using -g, introduces the lame's --nogap extension.
  * Added replygain using the appropiate tags with Ogg/Vorbis and Ogg/FLAC.
  * Replaygain is an action, not a flag, since it can be performed individualy
    in the chain of events.
  * debian/{rules,control}:
    - Changed the target directory from tmp to abcde, to accomodate to compat
    mode 4.
    - Bump standards to 3.6.2.1. No changes needed.
  * Added "decho" as a DEBUG output for some specific debug variables.
  * Added USEPIPES file, with information about how to add Unix pipes support.
  * Added one more checking for PIPES*_* unset variables (which means support
    is not added to abcde).
  * Added toolame as an optional MP3 encoder.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sat,  8 Oct 2005 17:05:32 +0300

abcde 2.3.4

  * Some patches from Tom Spindler <dogcow () babymeat ! com>
    - Added some quoting to the md5sum checkings, since the variables could be
      null.
    - NetBSD bits to use ftp instead on anything else to fetch stuff.
  * do_playlist needs to convert the OUTPUT to the CONTAINERS to avoid ending
    with playlists pointing to .vorbis files (Closes: #326487).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sat,  3 Sep 2005 16:50:07 +0300

abcde 2.3.3

  * Rips done in a single track were getting tagged as Various. Corrected.
  * Possibly eliminated some bashisms from using a variable as a variable
    (Closes: #324399). Thanks to A Costa.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 26 Aug 2005 01:36:35 +0300

abcde 2.3.2

  * Too fast... I forgot to make the tarball and change the version strings in
    several places. Fixed.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 19 Aug 2005 00:44:37 +0300

abcde 2.3.1

  * The new "I knew there were going to be bugs" upstream release!
  * MKCUE needs to be passed some $CDROM as an option, or otherwise it will
    not read the CDROM, in case is not /dev/cdrom.
  * Also, make the CUEREADER a bit more general, since we might be using other
    CUE extractors.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 18 Aug 2005 23:44:20 +0300

abcde 2.3.0

  * New upstream release!
  * Defining the tracknumber now resets the first track if given a number
    different than 1 (that is: abcde -T 1 2-10 creates songs 1 to 9).
  * Modified the FAQ to reflect the changes on Marillat's repo
    (Closes: #315724).
  * Should be "space" safe: works properly when the working directory contains
    a space (Closes: #147493).
  * Repared the CD query for the discid code. When failing to read a disc,
    actually report that there might be no disc in the drive.
  * Right now, walk over the different encoders we Depends: on in Debian and
    use the one available: if a user has a FLAC encoder, abcde will no install
    vorbis-tools, so it will fail to run out of the box (Closes: #321216)
  * Added CUE support. Still experimental...
  * Added FLAC on Ogg. Still not activated, since we cannot get comments added
    as a post-process action.
  * Applied patches from Fedora Core (Credit goes to Nils Philippsen
    <nphilipp@redhat.com>)
  * Added a post_read() function to be executed before ejecting the CD.
  * Typos reported by A Costa corrected (Closes: #311463)
  * Problem with abcde being run in a directory with files containing only
    numbers solved (Closes: #313628).
  * vorbiscomment uses now "-R" (Closes: #303566).
  * "-t" and "-T" use the first track as a starter for the track list.
    (Closes: #305749).
  * Added CDPARANOIACDROMBUS option to define -d in case of using IDE and SCSI
    in case of using ide-scsi emulation layer (Closes: #290768).
  * Define metaflac in abcde.conf (Closes: #303555)
  * Added the default "-f" option to the configuration file, to represent the
    actual default option.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 11 Aug 2005 00:47:27 +0300

abcde 2.2.6

  * Double quotation added to solve parsing * as a wildcard (Closes: #302904).
    Thanks to Christian Grigis for the patch. Also (Closes: #268088).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun,  3 Apr 2005 18:18:03 +0000

abcde 2.2.5

  * CDPARANOIAOUTPUT missed some quotes.
  * Removed some useless lines.
  * If BATCH is used with ONETRACK, disable BATCH.
  * Small typos with CDROM comparisons.
  * Logic for CDROM variable improved.
  * Version bumped to 2.2.5 and targeted to Sarge.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sat,  2 Apr 2005 21:05:18 +0300

abcde 2.2.4

  * Changed the way we call flac, to adapt to the new times:
    --import-vc-from= to --import-tags-from.
  * DOSPLAYLIST was not included in the list of options.
  * Options passed to the encoder by using <-o ogg:"-b 192"> are now
    supported. One can modify the way abcde encodes just for the current CD.
  * Unfortunatelly I forgot to add the starting number for tags in Ogg. For
    MP3 is a bit more difficult, since it needs changing the X/YY code.
  * Also, the order of the tags in metaflac is important for the utf8 names.
    Thanks to Frederik Juul Christiani (Closes: #297482)
  * Added CDROMID in the .conf file, for reader programs that need it
    (Closes: #297005)
  * Added a check for cdparanoia when encountering data-only CDs.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Tue,  1 Mar 2005 15:14:24 +0200

abcde 2.2.3

  * debian/control
    - suggest normalize-audio, since it changed its name (Closes: #287674).
  * Use the default while erasing an existing playlist (Closes: #288835).
  * Does not destroy track information when a track contains "=" in the name
    (Closes: #290709).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sat, 22 Jan 2005 15:35:46 +0200

abcde 2.2.2

  * Quotes missing when evaluating a value (Closes: #284018).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri,  3 Dec 2004 09:20:18 +0200

abcde 2.2.1

  * Spotted and solved a problem with the way the data tracks were detected
    (Closes: #282647).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Wed, 24 Nov 2004 22:47:54 +0200

abcde 2.2.0

  * New release! Let's see if abcde 2.2 gets into Sarge.
  * Added support for MPP/MP+(Musepack) encoding. Although I am trying to
    get 2.2 for Debian Sarge release, mpc seems safe enough to introduce. See
    corecodec.org for code.
  * Some POSIX shell corrections (making the code more portable). Thanks to
    Guillem Jover for pointing the problem out.
  * CDYEAR is also passed to do_move(), so one can use it for sorting the
    directories.
  * Small MacOS X fix, allowing directories with "()" to work. Thanks to Evan
    Jones.
    - On the MacOS X, I still do not know if abcde works correctly. If does
      not, please, drop a note. Or else.
  * DOSPLAYLIST also changes "/" with "\".
  * DATA tracks are now excluded from the ripping process using internally
    the cdparanoia "-Q" query option. If using another ripper, it does not
    work (at least there is no support for them in abcde)
    (Closes: #112692, #117412).
  * New "0" choice for "None of the above" has been introduced. If selected, a
    template is created and the user encouraged to edit it (Closes: #147683).
  * New options for when the PLAYLIST already exists: erase, append or keep.
  * Bug fixes along the code:
    - abcde.1 corrections and additions
    - abcde corrections and code reorganization. abcde now exits earlier if
      some of the options are incompatible. Also the actions are set as
      variables earlier, so we use less calls to external tools.
    - abcde.conf additions
  * The GENRE is munged now in its own mungegenre function, so that no more
    upper-to-lowercase is done (forced) except if the default is used.
  * Examples added to the tarball and /usr/share/doc/abcde/examples with two
    scripts to make abcde kind-of-a ripper daemon.
  * Changed to experimental to have an stable 2.1.x version in Sarge.
  * Add CDDB information to Ogg/Vorbis and FLAC files (Closes: #265358).
  * Added INTERACTIVE option. Set it to "n" and there you go, without user
    interaction.
  * Changes normalize to normalize-audio (Closes: #267053)
  * Copes with wav files being erased by the ripping tool.
  * Small patch to support ()'s in the path under MacOSX. Thanks to Evan Jones
    for noticing and sending the patch.
  * Added -w for COMMENT seed. Used to give a comment to a given CD.
  * Option "-t <number>" added to modify the numbering from a starting point
    (Closes: #95828). Geez! That is low bug number...
  * Added -T to modify also the tag entries on the songs. Currently available
    for FLAC and Ogg/Vorbis.
  * Removes trailing spaces (Closes: #280382).
  * TRACKNAME now combines multi-lines from long CDDB entries.
  * debian/rules:
    - s/dh_installmanpages/dh_installman/

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun,  7 Nov 2004 03:11:22 +0200

abcde 2.1.21

  * Changed normalize with normalize-audio (Closes: #267053).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 13:16:46 +0000

abcde 2.1.20

  * The "Let's have a good abcde in Sarge" release.
  * The mungefile() function changes * with + by default to avoid creating
    directories with the start expanded to the files found in the current
    directory. abcde2.2 will most likelly contain a better workaround.
  * Correct default OUTPUTFORMAT in man page (Closes: #250649)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 30 Jul 2004 10:16:46 +0300

abcde 2.1.19

  * Encoding the whole CD in one file is now possible. Use "-1" as a flag
    (Closes: #126267).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri,  9 Apr 2004 17:04:58 +0000

abcde 2.1.18

  * Do not release in a hurry. The eject program is not needed if CDSPEEDVALUE
    is not set and no EJECT action is performed (Closes: #242506)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu,  8 Apr 2004 05:18:49 +0000

abcde 2.1.17

  * Dud! Those missing quotes are going to kill me. Quotes restored and
    (Closes: #242508).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Wed,  7 Apr 2004 06:30:31 +0000

abcde 2.1.16

  * New setting for the CD speed. Some drives have a higher failure ratio when
    spinning at high speed.
  * Added a pre-read function for preparations. Uses include closing the CD
    tray (Closes: #137548).
  * Added COMMENT part in OggFlac metadata.
  * Documentation update: README, abcde.1
  * Do not tag GENRE and DATE in Ogg/Vorbis if CDDB does not provide them
    (Closes: #235531).
  * Solved bug with batch encoding, thanks to Travis McKay.
  * When *DATAPREFIX was set, the playlist creation was made without newline.
  * Added >&2 redirection to visualize the "Erase playlist" question
    (Closes: #241221).
  * Added the option "-m" to modify the resulting playlist, to contain CRLF at
    the end of every line, letting some hardware players which insist with
    DOS-style files to use them. Also, added DOSPLAYLIST as a config option.
  * When using a selected, localy cached CDDB entry, we forgot to show the
    selection when asking the user for editing the choice. Now we show it.
  * Improved the logic in the order of events when using a local CDDB repo.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Tue,  6 Apr 2004 05:29:38 +0000

abcde 2.1.15

  * EDITOR is called now evaluating the variable, so it works with full path
    and arguments.
  * Patch for making md5sum a variable (since some systems use a different
    name).
  * Correction by "huf" <mihi at mail.eol.hu>. The test code in line 376
    needed some quotes.
  * The PADDING code and some CDDB funcions were *really* messy. Now it looks
    cleaner, works faster and some not needed network operations are no
    longer performed when we are working with local CDDB repositories.
  * Added "-V" for extra verbosity (on slow networks the user might be waiting
    and wondering is somethins is happening).
  * Solved a bug with the non-interactive code.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Mon, 16 Feb 2004 00:13:12 +0000

abcde 2.1.14

  * Missing quotes restored (Closes: #228648).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Tue, 20 Jan 2004 06:43:04 +0000

abcde 2.1.13

  * Solved the problem with re-runs of multiple choices not showing all the
    choices (Closes: #228405) (this was a quick one)
  * We now show the selected CDDB entry on a second run, instead of all of
    them (not that one should stop abcde, but just in case). This way
    consecutive interrupted runs obtain the same results.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun, 18 Jan 2004 22:42:15 +0000

abcde 2.1.12

  * Check if normalizer is found in the PATH (Closes: #228014)
  * Added (commented) bits to check if the CD being processed is the CD on the
    tray, so that if differs we do not eject it.
  * Store locally the CDDB information, under $HOME/.cddb since it is being
    used by Grip (at least). PATH is user defined (Closes: #88048)
  * If you are using cdda2wav and SCSI drives, you can set CDROMID for the
    SCSI drive, since it differs from the cd-discid CDROM parameter
    (Closes: #121987).
  * MacOSX keeps on failing because the OS mounts the CD before we finish
    ripping it... or something else. Please, test test test the code, and
    report your findings. Pretty please. I have not been able to make it work
    with the reports I have received.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 16 Jan 2004 12:06:07 +0000

abcde 2.1.11

  * Urgent fixes for the FreeBSD and MacOSX bits. When using cdda2wav, the
    CDROM variable must be modified depending on the device interface. By now
    we will not try to be very smart.
  * Added a test for HTTPGETOPTS since it cannot be empty for the default
    HTTPGET options.
  * Quick release to fix a problem with the CDROM detection code.
    (Closes: #226647)
  * Cleaned a bashism. Thanks to Klaus Ethgen (Closes: #226782).
  * Rewrote some parts of the cdda2wav code. Since I do not have a machine
    where cdda2wav works, I cannot test the code. The modifications have been
    done following user reports. If you use cdda2wav and abcde does not work
    for you, please, contact me and we will try to sort things out. Thanks.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu,  8 Jan 2004 21:36:23 +0000

abcde 2.1.10

  * INLINETAG and STARTTRACKNUMBER flags added.
  * CDROM checking is now done with a bit more wiselly (Closes: #219768)
  * HTTPGET is only requested is "cddb" action is performed.
  * Workout the possibility of cdparanoia erasing our wav files
    (Closes: #172694)
  * The default answer for editing CDDB data is now "y" if the disk is
    unknown. If not, the default is "n". Requested by Ricky Buchanan.
  * Now we do not erase silently any previous $PLAYLISTFILE left behind by a
    previous CD ripping (Closes: #220753)
  * Write info file with cdda2wav (Closes: #187702).
    I do not use cdda2wav myself (me is cd-paranoid) so if anyone using
    cdda2wav has a problem with this, please, report.
  * CDROM comes in 1,0,0 kind of format for cdda2wav ripper. Corrected with a
    quick patch. Kudos go to Mikhail Manuilov <viper5k at pisem dot net> for
    noticing.
  * Merged bits to make abcde work under MacOSX. Thanks to Evan Jones.
  * Merged bits to avoid FreeDB people anger and to cut down the "abcde." part
    of the discid. Now you can set the "-C" command with the directory name.
    Kudos go to Bart Samwel.
  * Added some info bits to the config file about normalize, requested by
    Ricky Buchanan.
  * Added some testing for the wav file before normalizing, to check that the
    file is actually there.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Mon,  5 Jan 2004 14:43:59 +0000

abcde 2.1.9

  * The "First snow in Finland" release.
  * One head was missing a "-n"
  * Not use relative links when PLAYLISTDATAPREFIX is set (Closes: #165368)
  * Stupid use of $OUTPUTTYPE in flac tagging (Closes: #218625)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun,  2 Nov 2003 09:05:17 +0000

abcde 2.1.8

  * Small typo corrected (Closes: #217149)
  * KEEPWAVS now sets the "clean" action to "no", so the wavs are kept.
    (Closes: #216551)
  * Quick release fixing a couple of bugs introduced by the padding patch
    (Closes: #215962)
  * Control: Build-Depends-Indep: moved to Build-Depends:, as per
    http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-sourcebinarydeps
    (Closes: #214200)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 23 Oct 2003 09:49:01 +0000

abcde 2.1.7

  * The "Engineer" release. Yeah! I graduated!
  * Patch applied to solve the track submission interface issues. Kudos to
    Marc HE Brockschmidt, again (Closes: #126289)
  * Small bug related with DISTMP3NICE solved. Kudos to Wilbert Alberts.
    (Closes: #213756)
  * Padding now creates the list with padded numbers. Test patch. This should
    solve the problem with delayed tagging a single file.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 13 Oct 2003 09:50:09 +0000

abcde 2.1.6

  * Removed a nasty bug where even if the encode failed, the track was marked
    as successfully encoded (Closes: #208391)
  * Various Artists has now its own PLAYLIST format (Closes: #137432)
  * metaflac path corrected (Closes: #206110)
  * Hopefully this version repairs the comment part for Ogg/Vorbis files.
  * If nothing breaks, 2.2 will be released as soon as the KNOWNBUG is solved.
  * Removed all the inline tagging since it breaks the action chain, except
    in Ogg/Speex. Need to check if "vorbiscomment" can be used for it.
    (Closes: #206311)
  * Added DISTMP3NICE variable, to nice the distmp3 program (Closes: #208398)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu,  4 Sep 2003 10:53:09 +0000

abcde 2.1.5

  * Small fixes and patches.
    + GENRE can be used for OUTPUTFORMAT and PLAYLISTFORMAT
    + id3v2 should work now with -c for comments (Closes: #199949)
    + small bug with batch encoding
    + Variables are exported before the CDDB functions are called, so they
      should use the right variables for the HTTPGET command.
    + Tagging also use TRACKS and CDGENRE for MP3 files (kudos to Dirk
      Ruediger)
    + FLAC encoding now uses dismp3 to encode remotelly (kudos to Taylor and
      Kevin Cramer). HANDLE WITH CARE ;)
      Also FLAC now uses CDGENRE and CDYEAR for tagging.
  * tail/head change: -1 has been deprecated. Noted by Stephan Kulow.
  * Ogg/Speex support added, for speech encoding (Closes #204635)
  * Documentation update (Closes: #198825)
  * Patch for "=" in the name applied (Closes: #197199)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 14 Aug 2003 16:45:29 +0000

abcde 2.1.4

abcde 2.1.3

  * Makefile was missing cddb-tool.1.
  * Introduced dagrab as CD ripping utility.
  * cddb-tool seq calls converted to functions. No more distro dependencies.
  * WGET* variables converted to HTTPGET* variables. FreeBSD can safelly use
    fetch.
  * More FreeBSD specific bits: CDROM and EJECT changes.
  * Typo in abcde.conf
  * Added CDDBPROTO for specifying the protocol level of the cddb query.
  * CDDB protocol upgraded to 5. CDYEAR and CDGENRE are now used for CD
    tagging.
  * COMMENT is now used for inline tagging with oggenc (my mistake it was

abcde 2.1.2

  * Documentation updates: Closes: #186230.
  * Usual set of bug fixes and corrections.
  * Default behaviour of VAOUTPUTFORMAT output changed to avoid multiple
    directories for a same album. I think the format is more logical, and you
    can always split the files once they are created.
  * Padding track wavs with 0 so if you want to burn those wavs just cdrecord
    *.wav will do it. Use "-p" to force it when encoding a small (<9) number
    of files (Closes: #111627).
  * Added "KEEPWAVS" as a variable to keep those wavs. Default is "no". Can
    use also "-k" in the command line. (Closes: #160372).
    This probably should be changed with an option to move the wav files to
    another directory instead of just keep de abcde.<cdid> directory.
  * Added documentation comments about OUTPUTTYPE (Closes: #184963).
  * abcde.conf cleanup: (Closes: #186230, #187400).

  * Since abcde does not depend on eject, an execution test ([-x]) was added,

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Jun 2000

abcde 1.1.1

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Nov 1999

abcde 0.8.4

* New name. A Better CD Encoder. cdgrab was already taken - the original
  cdgrab name belongs to a CDDA reading program for DOS dating back to
  1993. It's still in use and active development, so I'm changing the
  name of cdgrab instead. See this URL for a description of the original
  cdgrab: http://www.scn.rain.com/pub/cdrom/cdgrab.txt

  Your old /etc/cdgrab.conf and/or ~/.cdgrab.conf can simply be
  renamed to /etc/abcde.conf and ~/.abcde.conf.

  The program name is now 'abcde'.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999

cdgrab 0.8.3

* cdgrab 0.7 through 0.8.2 would leave around cdgrab.xxxxxx

* Fixed a bug where if multiple tracks (but not the entire CD) was
  specificed explicitly, cdgrab would loop forever after the first track
* Now uses Debian's sensible-editor wrapper if available
* Merged in patches from Nathaniel J Smith that puts cddb lookup
  functionality in a separate script, cddb-tool
* Adds WAVOUTPUTDIR environment variable for those running out of space in
  OUTPUTDIR.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Aug 1999

cdgrab 0.7.7

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Aug 1999

cdgrab 0.7.6

* Another quick bugfix release - hopefully this will handle inexact matches
  properly now. (Thank you Robert Macaulay :)

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Aug 1999

cdgrab 0.7.5

* Quick bugfix release - with any luck I can start on 0.8 soon :)
* **** YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT CDGRAB.CONF **** if you use lame as
  /usr/bin/lamer. The default program name is now 'lame' as of lame v3.0.
  If you don't want to touch your lame installation, put the following in
  your cdgrab.conf: "LAME=lamer"
* Omits -w from cdparanoia commands
* Depends on cdparanoia-bin or cdparanoia now - this accomodates the recent
  cdparanoia package namechange.
* Fixed a stealth-whitespace typo at line 495. Thanks go to Gregory T.
  Norris for tracking this down.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Jul 1999

cdgrab 0.7.4

* Now only uses the first match from a CDDB datafile for the track
  information, this works around a cddb glitch some of you may have
  hit last month
* Default config file now gets version number from program.
* added 'debug' option to CDROMREADERSYNTAX to get cdparanoia to only rip
  the first 5 seconds of a track. This is very useful to those debugging
  cdgrab, makes things go much faster. This will also prevent me releasing
  another 0.7.2 :)
* Now puts options last on the encoder command line if you are using
  bladeenc or l3enc, this should allow the proper use of these encoders
  with additional commandline options (thanks to Justin Hugh Daly for
  pointing this out)
* m3u PLAYLIST SUPPORT! Check out the new -p and -P options!

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999

cdgrab 0.7.3

  mp3's, try this :)

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Sun, 16 May 1999

cdgrab 0.7.1

* LOWDISK/-l option added for those who don't have the disk space to run a
  parallelized session.
* MAXPROCS added to config file
* CDDB handling revisited - cdgrab should now properly handle CD's with
  multiple or inexact CDDB entries.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Fri, 14 May 1999

cdgrab 0.7

* Parallelizes ripping and encoding - this may take substantially more disk
  space temporarily (up to 500MB or so depending on how fast your CPU is
  compared to your cdrom drive) but cdgrab will be done with your CD
  much more quickly.
* Allows for SMP optimizations (multiple encoders running at once) with the
  new -j option
* Output fix for TOC printing
* cd-discid split off into it's own package

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Fri,  7 May 1999

cdgrab 0.4

* Added ALBUMFILE, fixed manpage reference to it
* Deletes editor backups from 'cdgrab -e' automagically
  (I wish mutt did this :)
* Bombs out if there's no CD in the drive
* Bombs out if any necessary external programs don't exist
* Encourages people to use brackets for OUTPUTFORMAT variables to
  handle formats like Artist/TrackName_Number.mp3

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Mar 1999
