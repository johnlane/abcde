abcde 2.2.0

  * New release! Let's see if abcde 2.2 gets into Sarge.
  * Added support for MPP/MP+(Musepack) encoding. Although I am trying to
    get 2.2 for Debian Sarge release, mpc seems safe enough to introduce. See
    corecodec.org for code.
  * Some POSIX shell corrections (making the code more portable). Thanks to
    Guillem Jover for pointing the problem out.
  * CDYEAR is also passed to do_move(), so one can use it for sorting the
    directories.
  * Small MacOS X fix, allowing directories with "()" to work. Thanks to Evan
    Jones.
    - On the MacOS X, I still do not know if abcde works correctly. If does
      not, please, drop a note. Or else.
  * DOSPLAYLIST also changes "/" with "\".
  * DATA tracks are now excluded from the ripping process using internally
    the cdparanoia "-Q" query option. If using another ripper, it does not
    work (at least there is no support for them in abcde)
    (Closes: #112692, #117412).
  * New "0" choice for "None of the above" has been introduced. If selected, a
    template is created and the user encouraged to edit it (Closes: #147683).
  * New options for when the PLAYLIST already exists: erase, append or keep.
  * Bug fixes along the code:
    - abcde.1 corrections and additions
    - abcde corrections and code reorganization. abcde now exits earlier if
      some of the options are incompatible. Also the actions are set as
      variables earlier, so we use less calls to external tools.
    - abcde.conf additions
  * The GENRE is munged now in its own mungegenre function, so that no more
    upper-to-lowercase is done (forced) except if the default is used.
  * Examples added to the tarball and /usr/share/doc/abcde/examples with two
    scripts to make abcde kind-of-a ripper daemon.
  * Changed to experimental to have an stable 2.1.x version in Sarge.
  * Add CDDB information to Ogg/Vorbis and FLAC files (Closes: #265358).
  * Added INTERACTIVE option. Set it to "n" and there you go, without user
    interaction.
  * Changes normalize to normalize-audio (Closes: #267053)
  * Copes with wav files being erased by the ripping tool.
  * Small patch to support ()'s in the path under MacOSX. Thanks to Evan Jones
    for noticing and sending the patch.
  * Added -w for COMMENT seed. Used to give a comment to a given CD.
  * Option "-t <number>" added to modify the numbering from a starting point
    (Closes: #95828). Geez! That is low bug number...
  * Added -T to modify also the tag entries on the songs. Currently available
    for FLAC and Ogg/Vorbis.
  * Removes trailing spaces (Closes: #280382).
  * TRACKNAME now combines multi-lines from long CDDB entries.
  * debian/rules:

abcde 2.1.21

  * Changed normalize with normalize-audio (Closes: #267053).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 13:16:46 +0000

abcde 2.1.20

  * The "Let's have a good abcde in Sarge" release.
  * The mungefile() function changes * with + by default to avoid creating
    directories with the start expanded to the files found in the current
    directory. abcde2.2 will most likelly contain a better workaround.
  * Correct default OUTPUTFORMAT in man page (Closes: #250649)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 30 Jul 2004 10:16:46 +0300

abcde 2.1.19

  * Encoding the whole CD in one file is now possible. Use "-1" as a flag
    (Closes: #126267).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri,  9 Apr 2004 17:04:58 +0000

abcde 2.1.18

  * Do not release in a hurry. The eject program is not needed if CDSPEEDVALUE
    is not set and no EJECT action is performed (Closes: #242506)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu,  8 Apr 2004 05:18:49 +0000

abcde 2.1.17

  * Dud! Those missing quotes are going to kill me. Quotes restored and
    (Closes: #242508).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Wed,  7 Apr 2004 06:30:31 +0000

abcde 2.1.16

  * New setting for the CD speed. Some drives have a higher failure ratio when
    spinning at high speed.
  * Added a pre-read function for preparations. Uses include closing the CD
    tray (Closes: #137548).
  * Added COMMENT part in OggFlac metadata.
  * Documentation update: README, abcde.1
  * Do not tag GENRE and DATE in Ogg/Vorbis if CDDB does not provide them
    (Closes: #235531).
  * Solved bug with batch encoding, thanks to Travis McKay.
  * When *DATAPREFIX was set, the playlist creation was made without newline.
  * Added >&2 redirection to visualize the "Erase playlist" question
    (Closes: #241221).
  * Added the option "-m" to modify the resulting playlist, to contain CRLF at
    the end of every line, letting some hardware players which insist with
    DOS-style files to use them. Also, added DOSPLAYLIST as a config option.
  * When using a selected, localy cached CDDB entry, we forgot to show the
    selection when asking the user for editing the choice. Now we show it.
  * Improved the logic in the order of events when using a local CDDB repo.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Tue,  6 Apr 2004 05:29:38 +0000

abcde 2.1.15

  * EDITOR is called now evaluating the variable, so it works with full path
    and arguments.
  * Patch for making md5sum a variable (since some systems use a different
    name).
  * Correction by "huf" <mihi at mail.eol.hu>. The test code in line 376
    needed some quotes.
  * The PADDING code and some CDDB funcions were *really* messy. Now it looks
    cleaner, works faster and some not needed network operations are no
    longer performed when we are working with local CDDB repositories.
  * Added "-V" for extra verbosity (on slow networks the user might be waiting
    and wondering is somethins is happening).
  * Solved a bug with the non-interactive code.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Mon, 16 Feb 2004 00:13:12 +0000

abcde 2.1.14

  * Missing quotes restored (Closes: #228648).

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Tue, 20 Jan 2004 06:43:04 +0000

abcde 2.1.13

  * Solved the problem with re-runs of multiple choices not showing all the
    choices (Closes: #228405) (this was a quick one)
  * We now show the selected CDDB entry on a second run, instead of all of
    them (not that one should stop abcde, but just in case). This way
    consecutive interrupted runs obtain the same results.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun, 18 Jan 2004 22:42:15 +0000

abcde 2.1.12

  * Check if normalizer is found in the PATH (Closes: #228014)
  * Added (commented) bits to check if the CD being processed is the CD on the
    tray, so that if differs we do not eject it.
  * Store locally the CDDB information, under $HOME/.cddb since it is being
    used by Grip (at least). PATH is user defined (Closes: #88048)
  * If you are using cdda2wav and SCSI drives, you can set CDROMID for the
    SCSI drive, since it differs from the cd-discid CDROM parameter
    (Closes: #121987).
  * MacOSX keeps on failing because the OS mounts the CD before we finish
    ripping it... or something else. Please, test test test the code, and
    report your findings. Pretty please. I have not been able to make it work
    with the reports I have received.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 16 Jan 2004 12:06:07 +0000

abcde 2.1.11

  * Urgent fixes for the FreeBSD and MacOSX bits. When using cdda2wav, the
    CDROM variable must be modified depending on the device interface. By now
    we will not try to be very smart.
  * Added a test for HTTPGETOPTS since it cannot be empty for the default
    HTTPGET options.
  * Quick release to fix a problem with the CDROM detection code.
    (Closes: #226647)
  * Cleaned a bashism. Thanks to Klaus Ethgen (Closes: #226782).
  * Rewrote some parts of the cdda2wav code. Since I do not have a machine
    where cdda2wav works, I cannot test the code. The modifications have been
    done following user reports. If you use cdda2wav and abcde does not work
    for you, please, contact me and we will try to sort things out. Thanks.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu,  8 Jan 2004 21:36:23 +0000

abcde 2.1.10

  * INLINETAG and STARTTRACKNUMBER flags added.
  * CDROM checking is now done with a bit more wiselly (Closes: #219768)
  * HTTPGET is only requested is "cddb" action is performed.
  * Workout the possibility of cdparanoia erasing our wav files
    (Closes: #172694)
  * The default answer for editing CDDB data is now "y" if the disk is
    unknown. If not, the default is "n". Requested by Ricky Buchanan.
  * Now we do not erase silently any previous $PLAYLISTFILE left behind by a
    previous CD ripping (Closes: #220753)
  * Write info file with cdda2wav (Closes: #187702).
    I do not use cdda2wav myself (me is cd-paranoid) so if anyone using
    cdda2wav has a problem with this, please, report.
  * CDROM comes in 1,0,0 kind of format for cdda2wav ripper. Corrected with a
    quick patch. Kudos go to Mikhail Manuilov <viper5k at pisem dot net> for
    noticing.
  * Merged bits to make abcde work under MacOSX. Thanks to Evan Jones.
  * Merged bits to avoid FreeDB people anger and to cut down the "abcde." part
    of the discid. Now you can set the "-C" command with the directory name.
    Kudos go to Bart Samwel.
  * Added some info bits to the config file about normalize, requested by
    Ricky Buchanan.
  * Added some testing for the wav file before normalizing, to check that the
    file is actually there.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Mon,  5 Jan 2004 14:43:59 +0000

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun,  2 Nov 2003 09:05:17 +0000

abcde 2.1.8

  * Small typo corrected (Closes: #217149)
  * KEEPWAVS now sets the "clean" action to "no", so the wavs are kept.
    (Closes: #216551)
  * Quick release fixing a couple of bugs introduced by the padding patch
    (Closes: #215962)
  * Control: Build-Depends-Indep: moved to Build-Depends:, as per
    http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-sourcebinarydeps
    (Closes: #214200)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 23 Oct 2003 09:49:01 +0000

abcde 2.1.7

  * Small bug related with DISTMP3NICE solved. Kudos to Wilbert Alberts.
    (Closes: #213756)
  * Padding now creates the list with padded numbers. Test patch. This should
    solve the problem with delayed tagging a single file.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 13 Oct 2003 09:50:09 +0000

abcde 2.1.6

  * Various Artists has now its own PLAYLIST format (Closes: #137432)
  * metaflac path corrected (Closes: #206110)
  * Hopefully this version repairs the comment part for Ogg/Vorbis files.
  * If nothing breaks, 2.2 will be released as soon as the KNOWNBUG is solved.
  * Removed all the inline tagging since it breaks the action chain, except
    in Ogg/Speex. Need to check if "vorbiscomment" can be used for it.
    (Closes: #206311)
  * Added DISTMP3NICE variable, to nice the distmp3 program (Closes: #208398)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu,  4 Sep 2003 10:53:09 +0000

abcde 2.1.5

  * Small fixes and patches.
    + GENRE can be used for OUTPUTFORMAT and PLAYLISTFORMAT
    + id3v2 should work now with -c for comments (Closes: #199949)
    + small bug with batch encoding
    + Variables are exported before the CDDB functions are called, so they
      should use the right variables for the HTTPGET command.
    + Tagging also use TRACKS and CDGENRE for MP3 files (kudos to Dirk
      Ruediger)
    + FLAC encoding now uses dismp3 to encode remotelly (kudos to Taylor and
      Kevin Cramer). HANDLE WITH CARE ;)
      Also FLAC now uses CDGENRE and CDYEAR for tagging.
  * tail/head change: -1 has been deprecated. Noted by Stephan Kulow.
  * Ogg/Speex support added, for speech encoding (Closes #204635)
  * Documentation update (Closes: #198825)
  * Patch for "=" in the name applied (Closes: #197199)

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Thu, 14 Aug 2003 16:45:29 +0000

abcde 2.1.4

  * Small bug fixes:
    + COMMENT should work now.
    + Aesthetic padding on the total amount of tracks.
    + CDROM typo
    + CDROM is now checked after reading the user defined entries.
  * Remove trailing args from $EDITOR when checking -x: Closes #179222.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun, 18 May 2003 18:47:36 +0000

abcde 2.1.3

  * Makefile was missing cddb-tool.1.
  * Introduced dagrab as CD ripping utility.
  * cddb-tool seq calls converted to functions. No more distro dependencies.
  * WGET* variables converted to HTTPGET* variables. FreeBSD can safelly use
    fetch.
  * More FreeBSD specific bits: CDROM and EJECT changes.
  * Typo in abcde.conf
  * Added CDDBPROTO for specifying the protocol level of the cddb query.
  * CDDB protocol upgraded to 5. CDYEAR and CDGENRE are now used for CD
    tagging.
  * COMMENT is now used for inline tagging with oggenc (my mistake it was
    missing): Closes: #191475.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sat, 10 May 2003 07:49:22 +0000
 
abcde 2.1.2

  * Documentation updates: Closes: #186230.
  * Usual set of bug fixes and corrections.
  * Default behaviour of VAOUTPUTFORMAT output changed to avoid multiple
    directories for a same album. I think the format is more logical, and you
    can always split the files once they are created.
  * Padding track wavs with 0 so if you want to burn those wavs just cdrecord
    *.wav will do it. Use "-p" to force it when encoding a small (<9) number
    of files (Closes: #111627).
  * Added "KEEPWAVS" as a variable to keep those wavs. Default is "no". Can
    use also "-k" in the command line. (Closes: #160372).
    This probably should be changed with an option to move the wav files to
    another directory instead of just keep de abcde.<cdid> directory.
  * Added documentation comments about OUTPUTTYPE (Closes: #184963).
  * abcde.conf cleanup: (Closes: #186230, #187400).

  * Since abcde does not depend on eject, an execution test ([-x]) was added,
    but that means abcde needs a test for eject in the patch if -x is passed:

* Switched default output type to ogg, default encoder to oggenc
* Since 1.9.x prompts for CDDB edits by default there is now a -N switch
  for non-interactivity.
* Handles cddb entries with random sprinklings of CR's and LF's
* You can now specify niceness for the reader and encoders, thanks to
  Kevin Everets <kevin.everets@alcatel.com>
* -j 0 will now disable local encoding, thanks to Antonio Fiol
  <Antonio.FIOL@enst-bretagne.fr>
* Vorbize should actually work now, thanks to Kevin Everets and James
  LewisMoss
* Oggenc/Vorbize commenting support
* Made TRACKNUM available for playlist generation
* Fleshed out the TODO list a bit more
* mungefilename() now translates ':' to ' -' by default. Rationale: You
  can't put ':' on a FAT filesystem. It also wreaks havoc with Samba.

    completely untested

* The "" Release.
* Completely redone tmpfile handling, abcde can now continue where you left
  off. closes: #42970, #50883, #66668

* Moved cddb-tool interactivity to abcde, 'cddb-tool get' no longer exists,
  it is now 'cddb-tool query' and 'cddb-tool read'.
* Removed -e, -v, and -V, since abcde will now prompt you if you want to
  edit or otherwise muck with the data after you have a chance to see it.

abcde 1.1.1

* The "That wasn't chicken" release.

  0.8.3

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Nov 1999

abcde 0.8.4

* New name. A Better CD Encoder. cdgrab was already taken - the original
  cdgrab name belongs to a CDDA reading program for DOS dating back to
  1993. It's still in use and active development, so I'm changing the
  name of cdgrab instead. See this URL for a description of the original
  cdgrab: http://www.scn.rain.com/pub/cdrom/cdgrab.txt

  Your old /etc/cdgrab.conf and/or ~/.cdgrab.conf can simply be
  renamed to /etc/abcde.conf and ~/.abcde.conf.

  The program name is now 'abcde'.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999

cdgrab 0.8.3

* cdgrab 0.7 through 0.8.2 would leave around cdgrab.xxxxxx
  tempfiles with -j. Fixed that.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Sep 1999

cdgrab 0.8

  specificed explicitly, cdgrab would loop forever after the first track
* Now uses Debian's sensible-editor wrapper if available
* Merged in patches from Nathaniel J Smith that puts cddb lookup
  functionality in a separate script, cddb-tool
* Adds WAVOUTPUTDIR environment variable for those running out of space in
  OUTPUTDIR.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Aug 1999

cdgrab 0.7.7

* Yet another quick fix to finish what 0.7.6 started - cdgrab should now
  handle multiple inexact matches as well. (Thanks again to Robert Macaulay)

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Aug 1999

cdgrab 0.7.6

* Another quick bugfix release - hopefully this will handle inexact matches
  properly now. (Thank you Robert Macaulay :)

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Aug 1999

cdgrab 0.7.5

* Quick bugfix release - with any luck I can start on 0.8 soon :)
* **** YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT CDGRAB.CONF **** if you use lame as
  /usr/bin/lamer. The default program name is now 'lame' as of lame v3.0.
  If you don't want to touch your lame installation, put the following in
  your cdgrab.conf: "LAME=lamer"
* Omits -w from cdparanoia commands
* Depends on cdparanoia-bin or cdparanoia now - this accomodates the recent
  cdparanoia package namechange.
* Fixed a stealth-whitespace typo at line 495. Thanks go to Gregory T.
  Norris for tracking this down.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Jul 1999

cdgrab 0.7.4

* Now only uses the first match from a CDDB datafile for the track
  information, this works around a cddb glitch some of you may have
  hit last month
* Default config file now gets version number from program.
* added 'debug' option to CDROMREADERSYNTAX to get cdparanoia to only rip
  the first 5 seconds of a track. This is very useful to those debugging
  cdgrab, makes things go much faster. This will also prevent me releasing
  another 0.7.2 :)
* Now puts options last on the encoder command line if you are using
  bladeenc or l3enc, this should allow the proper use of these encoders
  with additional commandline options (thanks to Justin Hugh Daly for
  pointing this out)
* m3u PLAYLIST SUPPORT! Check out the new -p and -P options!

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jun 1999

cdgrab 0.7.3

* Fixes wget calling method
* -l/LOWDISK documented
* Fixes the lowdisk #2 option so it exits cleanly

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Sun, 23 May 1999

cdgrab 0.7.2

* Woops, left some debugging code in 0.7.1 - if you have truckloads of 80kb
  mp3's, try this :)

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Sun, 16 May 1999

cdgrab 0.7.1

* LOWDISK/-l option added for those who don't have the disk space to run a
  parallelized session.
* MAXPROCS added to config file
* CDDB handling revisited - cdgrab should now properly handle CD's with
  multiple or inexact CDDB entries.

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Fri, 14 May 1999

cdgrab 0.7

* Parallelizes ripping and encoding - this may take substantially more disk
  space temporarily (up to 500MB or so depending on how fast your CPU is
  compared to your cdrom drive) but cdgrab will be done with your CD
  much more quickly.
* Allows for SMP optimizations (multiple encoders running at once) with the
  new -j option
* Output fix for TOC printing
* cd-discid split off into it's own package

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Fri,  7 May 1999

  (without CDDB, you might as well use cdparanoia -B)

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Mar 1999

cdgrab 0.4

* Added ALBUMFILE, fixed manpage reference to it
* Deletes editor backups from 'cdgrab -e' automagically
  (I wish mutt did this :)
* Bombs out if there's no CD in the drive
* Bombs out if any necessary external programs don't exist
* Encourages people to use brackets for OUTPUTFORMAT variables to
  handle formats like Artist/TrackName_Number.mp3

  -- Robert Woodcock <rcw@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Mar 1999

cdgrab 0.3

  command line, use 'cdgrab -d device' now to get the same result.
